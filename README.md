## 1. Overview

The DENSO robot ROS2 stack contains packages that provide nodes for communication with DENSO industrial robot controllers (RC8/RC8A and RC9).
The robot controller models that are currently supported are the following:

  - RC8 controller
  - RC8 controller (COBOTTA - not OSS)
  - RC8A controller
  - RC9 controller (**under construction**)

The supported robot models are the following:

  - 4-Axis (SCARA) robots
  - 5-and 6-Axis robots
  - Collaborative robots (not OSS type)


Moreover, the DENSO robot ROS2 stack provides URDF models for COBOTTA and VS-060 robotic arms and associated [MoveIt2](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/index.html) configuration packages (as standard components).
To control other robot types, see the _ROS2Converter_ page (**under construction**) for creating the URDF model and the associated [MoveIt2](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/index.html) configuration package.

   ```


## 4. Controller Preparation

`denso_robot_ros2` packages use [b-CAP communication](https://www.denso-wave.com/en/robot/product/function/b-CAP.html), which is ORiN2 communication standard, to control DENSO robots.
Following are the instructions to setup DENSO hardware in order to interface DENSO ROS2 nodes with simulated or real robot.

### Simulated Environment with WINCAPS III
For controlling a WINCAPS III-simulated robot, a Windows computer is needed.
Windows computer where WINCAPS III runs.
The following steps show how to install and start a [b-CAP](https://www.denso-wave.com/en/robot/product/function/b-CAP.html) server on the Windows machine.

1. Install WINCAPS III in Windows computer. ORiN2 SDK, VRC, and DENSO ROBOTICS License Manager are installed with WINCAPS III simultaneously.

2. License registration: to control a WINCAPS III-simulated robot, the licenses of ORiN2 SDK, VRC, and WINCAPS III are required.
    Please inquire the following licenses of our sales staff.

| Application | License Type |
| :-------------: | :-----------------: |
| ORiN2 SDK | DENSO Products or higher |
| VRC | VRC kernel or higher |
| WINCAPS III | WINCAPS III product version or higher |


  To register ORiN2 SDK license, use _CaoConfig_ application. From the Start menu, select \[ORiN 2\]-\[CAO\]-\[CaoConfig\].

| *License registration for ORiN2 SDK* |
|:--:| 
| ![License registration for ORiN2 SDK - 1](docs/images/caoconfig_en.jpg) | 
| ![License registration for ORiN2 SDK - 2](docs/images/caoconfig_registration_en.jpg) | 


  To register licenses of VRC and WINCAPS III, use DENSO ROBOTICS _License Manager_ application.
  From the Start menu, \[DENSO ROBOTICS\]-\[LicenseManager\].

| *License registration for VRC and WINCAPSIII* |
|:--:| 
| ![License registration for VRC and WINCAPSIII - 1](docs/images/licensemanager_en.jpg) | 
| ![License registration for VRC and WINCAPSIII - 2](docs/images/licensemanager_registration_en.jpg) | 


3. Change the IP address of the Windows computer so that it can be accessed from the ROS2 computer.

4. To configure a b-CAP server, use _bCapConfig_ application.
    The _bCapConfig_ application is automatically installed in the following path when ORiN2 SDK is installed:

    `${ORiN2}\CAO\ProviderLib\b-CAP\bCAPListener\Bin\bCapConfig.exe`


    Start _bCapConfig_ tool and configure b-CAP server.
    From the menu bar, select \[File\]-\[Import\], and then open the _"rc8_bcap_cnf.xml"_ file.
    Once the file opens, select \[File\]-\[Save\] to save the settings.

| *b-CAP server configuration* |
|:--:| 
| ![b-CAP server configuration - 1](docs/images/bcapconfig_en.jpg) | 
| ![b-CAP server configuration - 2](docs/images/bcapconfig_xml_en.jpg) | 


5. To start b-CAP server, from the Menu bar of bCapConfig, select \[Action\]-\[Service Start\].
    As the b-CAP server stops once the Windows computer shuts down, please restart the b-CAP server after the computer shut down.

| *b-CAP server start* |
|:--:| 
| ![b-CAP server start](docs/images/bcapconfig_servicestart_en.jpg) | 


6. Create a WINCAPS III project of a controlled robot.
    If the `denso_robot_ros` package does not include an intended robot type for simulation, import the robot type according to the _ROS2Converter_ page (**under construction**).

7. Start WINCAPS III and then open a robot project to simulate.
    Once the project opens, from the Menu bar, select \[Debug\]-\[Simulation mode\] to change WINCAPS III to the simulation mode.


### Real Robot

**NOTE**: The steps described in this section only apply to RC8, RC8A and COBOTTA controllers !!

**(RC9 instructions are under construction)**

For controlling a real DENSO robot, the RC8 controller must be configured.

1. Change the IP address of the RC8 controller so that it can be accessed from the ROS2 computer.

| *IP address configuration (RC8 controller)* |
|:--:| 
| ![IP address configuration (RC8 controller)](docs/images/ipaddress_setting_en.jpg) | 


2. Set the _Executable Token_ to **"Any"** or **"Ethernet"** and set the IP address for the _Execution Token_ to the IP address of the ROS2 PC.
    From the Teach Pendant, select \[F6 Setting\]-\[F5 Communication and Token\]-\[F1 Executable Token\]:
    select Ethernet as the _Executable Token_ and input the IP address of the ROS2 PC by pressing \[F5 Edit\].
    Please note that both PC and RC8 should be in the same network.

| *Executable Token configuration (RC8 controller)* |
|:--:| 
| ![Executable Token configuration (RC8 controller)](docs/images/executable_token.png) | 


**FOLLOWING STEPS ARE ONLY REQUIRED IN CASE THE** [SlaveMode robot control](docs/SlaveMode.md) **MODALITY IS SELECTED !!**

3. To control an RC8 controller with [MoveIt2](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/index.html), use _b-CAP Slave_ function.
    To activate the _b-CAP Slave_ function, please check the license of the RC8 from the DENSO WAVE member site (logon required).

| *DENSO WAVE member site logon* |
|:--:| 
| ![DENSO WAVE member site logon](docs/images/member_site_en.jpg) | 


4. Read RC8 serial number from the teach pendant.

| *Read RC8 controller serial number* |
|:--:| 
| ![Read RC8 controller serial number](docs/images/serial_number_en.jpg) | 


5. Check the _b-CAP Slave_ license from the _RC8 Free License Confirmation_ page on the DENSO WAVE member site.

| *b-CAP Slave license generation* |
|:--:| 
| ![b-CAP Slave license generation - 1](docs/images/free_license_en.jpg) | 
| ![b-CAP Slave license generation - 2](docs/images/b-CAP_Slave_en.jpg) | 


6. Register the license key confirmed in _RC8 Free License Confirmation_ page in the RC8 controller. Reboot the RC8 controller after the license registration.

| *b-CAP Slave license registration* |
|:--:| 
| ![b-CAP Slave license registration](docs/images/registration_en.jpg) | 


7. Create a robot definition file: `denso_robot_ros package` provides URDF models for _cobotta_ and _vs060_ robots, and associated [MoveIt2](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/index.html) configuration packages as standard components.
    To control other robot types, see the _ROS2Converter_ page (**under construction**).

8. Set speed/acceleration parameters: the URDF models and the associated [MoveIt2]https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/index.html) configuration packages created by _ROS2Converter_ have dummy speed/acceleration parameters.
    To specify the actual speed/acceleration parameters, see the _AcquireVelAcc_ page (**under construction**).


## 5. ROS2 Nodes Usage

Three different control modalities can be selected for DENSO robots:

  - [b-CAP command interface](docs/b-CAP.md)
  - [ORiN2 command interface](docs/ORiN2.md)
  - [SlaveMode robot control](docs/SlaveMode.md)

## 6. Single-Arm and Dual-Arm Setups

The DENSO ROS2 stack supports both single-arm and dual-arm configurations, using dedicated launch files in the `denso_robot_bringup` package. The only difference between the two setups is which launch file you use — `denso_robot_bringup.launch.py` for single-arm, or `dual_denso_robot_bringup.launch.py` for dual-arm — the rest of the arguments work the same way.

The arguments for launch files can be listed using:

```bash
ros2 launch denso_robot_bringup denso_robot_bringup.launch.py --show-args
```

For dual-arm (**VS-050 only**):

```bash
ros2 launch denso_robot_bringup dual_denso_robot_bringup.launch.py --show-args
```

Example (simulated single-arm VS-050 with simulator camera and RViz):
```bash
ros2 launch denso_robot_bringup denso_robot_bringup.launch.py model:=vs050 sim:=true gz_cam:=true rviz:=true
```

For more information, see [SlaveMode robot control](docs/SlaveMode.md).
